# About Respository:

"All the Python, NumPy &amp; Pandas you need to know before Machine Learning."

-> python-for-ml.ipynb file is a guide/study material for Python Programming Language and it's most famous libraries (NumPy & Pandas) which are a basic necessity before diving into the field of Machine Learning.

-> I compiled this from various sources which are also mentioned before every topic.

-> This can greatly reduce the struggle I faced, i.e. the dilemma of having many resources but no clear idea.

-> Have fun & keep coding!
